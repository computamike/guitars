Price : Possibly Â£110 (ish) - bought many years ago (pre 2009)

## History
I had decided to treat myself to a guitar - I had been working and was earning decent money, and had bought my own house.  So I decided to go to Halesowen, and popped into MIR and had bought myself a Vintage brand acoustic Guitar, and gig bag.
