Today was the day - I had previously "Serviced" the electricals of this guitar but had hoped to install new strings, and I was curious as to the reason why the middle pickup was falling into the body.

I carefully loosened the strings, as I didn't want to drastically and dramatically alter the neck load too quickly.  As I loosened the strings, the high E string snapped at the nut - this suggests that there may be some form of imperfection in the nut slot and will be something that needs to be looked at in the future.

### Removing the scratch plate
The scratch plate is secured using 11 screws - these seemed to range in size  from 12.7mm down to 10.2mm - A packet of replacement screws (3mmx12mm) has been obtained from Amazon.com - however the test screw revealed that the screwdriver that I had was not optimally sized for this screwhead, and the existing screws are potentially smaller than the 12mm replacements.  Using these slightly longer screws should be possible - however pilot holes may be needed.  It is anticipated that a 2mm drill bit would be suitable to extend the existing screw holes.

The existing scratch plate has been de-soldered from the output jack, and the jack has been removed (I plan to replace this with a more standard compliant black and white cable.)

### Scratch-plate
A new scratch-plate has been ordered from Amazon.com - and hopefully  the screw holes will align.  Alternatively the pickups and hardware will be harvested from this board and used to populate the existing board - or if that is not possible, the replacement will be sold.  

## Broken Pickup
The middle pickup has - at some stage - received some damage - possibly by something hitting or dropping onto the bottom of the pickup.  This broke the plastic bottom layer, meaning that the screw was no longer able to adjust.
