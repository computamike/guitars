Today was the day - I had previously "Serviced" the electricals of this guitar but had hoped to install new strings, and I was curious as to the reason why the middle pickup was falling into the body.

I carefully loosened the strings, as I didn't want to drastically and dramatically alter the neck load too quickly.  As I loosened the strings, the high E string snapped at the nut - this suggests that there may be some form of imperfection in the nut slot and will be something that needs to be looked at in the future.

### Removing the scratch plate
The scratch plate is secured using 11 screws - these seemed to range in size  from 12.7mm down to 10.2mm - A packet of replacement screws (3mmx12mm) has been obtained from Amazon.com - however the test screw revealed that the screwdriver that I had was not optimally sized for this screwhead, and the existing screws are potentially smaller than the 12mm replacements.  Using these slightly longer screws should be possible - however pilot holes may be needed.  It is anticipated that a 2mm drill bit would be suitable to extend the existing screw holes.

The existing scratch plate has been de-soldered from the output jack, and the jack has been removed (I plan to replace this with a more standard compliant black and white cable.)

### Scratch-plate
A new scratch-plate has been ordered from Amazon.com - and hopefully  the screw holes will align.  Alternatively the pickups and hardware will be harvested from this board and used to populate the existing board - or if that is not possible, the replacement will be sold.  

## Broken Pickup
The middle pickup has - at some stage - received some damage - possibly by something hitting or dropping onto the bottom of the pickup.  This broke the plastic bottom layer, meaning that the screw was no longer able to adjust.

## 2025-08-24 Replacement Parts
A replacement [fully loaded scratch plate](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07V333M5J?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) was ordered from Musiclily - Musiclily 11-Hole SSS Prewired Loaded Pickguard with Single Coil Pickups Set for Fender Squier Strat Electric Guitar,4Ply Aged White Pearl

Initial investigations revealed that some of the hole of the scratch plate do not align with the existing holes, but a good majority of them do.  Comparing the new scratch plate with the old revealed that there would need to be some modification to the neck cutaway - as the neck cannot be used directly.  I have decided that there is probably less work in modifying the new scratch plate, rather than moving the electrics to the old scratch plate

> Aligning the old and new scratch plate reveals the material to be removed.  Also notice that the old scratch plate has flaking - potentially from filing.

The existing electrics have been removed from the old scratch plate and have been stored in a zip lock bag.  Hopefully these might be still useful as spares - but in all likelihood won't be required when the new scratch plate is installed.

### Theories about the history of this guitar.
Looking at the scratch plate and pickup covers reveals that they are potentially different ages.  There is sign of yellowing on the pickup that don't appear on the plate itself.  My current theory is that something damaged the scratch plate of this guitar and the electrics were transferred to a new plate.  The scratch plate and tremello cover appear to be different plastics which - I feel - supports this theory.

I believe that the electronics were moved to the new scratch plate. I believe the middle pickup was damaged after this point, as there broken pickup parts were found inside the scratch plate cavity.
