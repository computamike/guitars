> Black Encore

I had popped into Kingswinford Old Curiosity Shop to look for any Vinyl - I always look around for Warley Male Choir Vinyl to try and finish my collection.

I had seen this black encore and I had been surprised - as it was the first one I had seen in an antique shop, and I was aware that this was something that had been bought new - possibly in the late 80's or 90's and was now an antique.

Initial inspection revealed that the scratch plate still had the protective film on it, and this has lead me to believe that this guitar had been played a bit, and then put away.

## Initial inspection:
The guitar looks to have a different headstock shape than the [[Red Encore Guitar]] - and interestingly has a truss rod adjustment at the headstock end of the guitar - this might aid in the dating of this instrument.  

The strings did not feel great on this guitar, and plugging it into an amp revealed that the volume pot was making intermittent contact, and effectively muting the guitar.  Rotating the pot eventually revealed a sound - indicating that the rest of the wiring is probably in a decent condition, and that the volume pot probably needs replacing, or cleaning. 

There are (what seem to be) slight finish cracks either side of the neck pocket, and these will require investigation to confirm that they are indeed finish cracks, and are not structural.

## Weight
The weight of this guitar is deceptively light - in comparison to the [[Red Encore Guitar]] - this feels a much lighter instrument.
## Initial thoughts
I think I may have possibly overspent on this guitar - however if it is a newer guitar model than the [Red Encore Guitar] then It might clean or brush up to make a decent regular playing guitar.

I did spot a similar guitar on [Ebay - (Encore E60 Blaster Electric Guitar - Gloss Black)](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/356528511849?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D777008%26algo%3DPERSONAL.TOPIC%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20250324084321%26meid%3D1fce8b78742c4bab97e95f18f2381b24%26pid%3D101949%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26itm%3D356528511849%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D4375194%26algv%3DRecentlyViewedItemsV2WithMLRPboosterAndUpdatedFeatures_BP%26brand%3DUnbranded&_trksid=p4375194.c101949.m162918&_trkparms=parentrq%3Ac70c318c1970ac723a2ed00afffcef5e%7Cpageci%3A5fdfc822-56a1-11f0-bf9d-82589f842732%7Ciid%3A1%7Cvlpname%3Avlp_homepage), however there would still be some delivery costs, and this was currently going for £47.52.  This advert describes it as a child's size guitar (so 3/4?) - A new E60 Blaster seems to have a price of £140-160![[Pasted image 20250701183746.png]]

## Service History
A liberal dose of contact cleaner was sprayed onto the scratch plate, with the aim to wick the contact cleaner into the pot.  Rotating the pot a few times loosened up whatever had been blocking the pot.   The guitar now works (electrically).  there are still issues around the pickup being dropped into body.

### Shielding
Playing this guitar identified a potential issue with shielding - which may well affect this guitar, should it be gigged - however I currently plan to record using a home set up - shielding may not be as important in this sort of environment.  I will record some songs on it, and see whether shielding is going to be a problem
